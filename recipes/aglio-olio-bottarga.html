    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Muggine bottarga (cured mullet roe) is an ancient traditional food from the island of Sardinia in Italy. 
           I have enjoyed this treat for so many years I just had to share it with you. A classic pasta dish from Italy becomes a specialty by adding bottarga 
           to it. Enjoy!

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 red chile pepper, seeded and minced </li>
        <li>2 ounces grated Sardinian mullet bottarga, divided</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley</li>
        <li>1 small lemon, zested</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
            until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add garlic to the oil and cook until just warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chile pepper and stir together, 
            reducing the temperature to medium-low. Continue stirring. The garlic should never become dark brown or crispy. 
            If this has happened, the garlic is burnt and no longer appropriate for consumption.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, reserving at least 1 cup pasta water. Add the spaghetti to the oil mixture, still on medium-low heat. 
            Stir or toss until all the spaghetti is well coated. Add 3/4 of the bottarga and stir to mix with the spaghetti, 
            adding the reserved pasta water to hydrate as needed. There should be a little "sauce" when serving but not soupy.</li>
        <li>Divide onto 4 plates and sprinkle with chopped parsley and lemon zest; squeeze lemon juice over and sprinkle remaining bottarga on 
            top right before serving.</li>
    </ol>
