    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Moist and tender salmon with a slightly sweet and salty crust—it's the perfect bite! 
           This recipe is easy and a nice choice to serve for guests who aren't used to eating salmon. Garnish with lemon slices and fresh 
           parsley and serve alongside rice pilaf or roasted sweet potatoes.
